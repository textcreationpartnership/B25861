            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

               <salute>Dear SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Cannot but wonder at your Confidence, in staying in <hi>England</hi> among the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal <hi>Betlem</hi> of Resolute <hi>Hereticks;</hi> for I think the people are all Mad, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve to question the integrity of the Saints, since they have Impeached the Justice: I hear with great trouble, that you have got your <hi>Quietus est,</hi> and have left the Wool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pack, and thrown from your Shoulders that great Grievance of the Nation, Justice: You are no longer mounted like <hi>Radaman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thus</hi> on the Bench, weighing the very essence of all Causes to a Mite, in the Golden Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lances of Judgement. I should have taken you for <hi>Justice</hi> her self, but they say She is Blind, and I am sure you can see (as the old homely Proverb has it) <hi>which side your Bread is Butter'd on.</hi> Let ever one speak as they find, I am sure you dealt Justly by me, for I protest I am as Innocent as the Child that is unborn, and have been acquitted by the Law, and therefore if I pleased might return to <hi>England,</hi> but I have several Reasons, best known to my self, for my staying on this side the Water: but <hi>Mor blew,</hi> 'tis not to Plot, I leave that to the <hi>Jesuits,</hi> who are a sort of people, I have nothing to do with: I cannot but remember your former Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and having no other means, as the <hi>French</hi> Proverb has it, <hi>Je vous paye en Monnoye de Cordelier,</hi> I will pay you with Thanks and Prayers; And I hope to see you again Triumphant with the Purse in your Hand: But in the mean time, I In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite you to <hi>Paris,</hi> I think it would be a great deal of Prudence to shun the Storm that is like to blow from <hi>Oxford,</hi> about the 21th. of <hi>March</hi> next, as I find predicted by seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Judicious <hi>Astrologers:</hi> Here you will be out of Harms way, and who knows but you may become at <hi>Paris</hi> as famous for Law and Justice, as I am grown for Phisick, I am in great practice, and live like my self: I have lately purchas'd the Receipts of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam—of her Heirs, at the value of 300 Pistols, in which I have found out the Quintessence of Poysons, a Secret I much studied all my Life. I have also here met with a <hi>Jew,</hi> and a Disguised <hi>Banian,</hi> who came lately out of the Great <hi>Moguls</hi> Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritories, both which, have furnished me with most choice Druggs, not to be had in <hi>Spain</hi> or <hi>Italy.</hi> I will shortly send you a pair of perfum'd Gloves, to present your Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies with, never fear the Operation, the Effluvia shall blast like the Pestilence, and at several Leagues distance. Every man ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his Calling, for <hi>Medicina est scientia Insalubrium,</hi> as well as <hi>Salubrium,</hi> and is <hi>Adjectio</hi> and <hi>Substractio,</hi> to Kill <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundum Artem</hi> requires as much Skill, as to cure, and we are most useful either way among Mortals. By <hi>Aesculapius</hi> the Bearded Son of <hi>Apollo,</hi> I cannot refrain Excursions in my own Element, but I hope you will pardon me, and for that I must enquire after the state of your Body. It is my Opinion, that this Air will be much more agreeable to your Constitution, than that of <hi>London.</hi> The Spring is now coming on, and the latter end of <hi>March,</hi> or the beginning of <hi>April,</hi> will be a most Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable time to move your Body, but I beseech you, not to take any <hi>Parlimentary</hi> Pills, they have too much <hi>Colecinthida</hi> in
<pb facs="tcp:186805:2"/>them, and will work too violently; you have but a tender Body, none knows so well your constitution as my self; I wish I could Inspect your Water, if it be bloody it is an ill sign. I think the <hi>Spa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">
